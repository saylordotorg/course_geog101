**Unit 5: Middle America** <span id="5"></span> 
*Middle America, the geographic realm between the United States and the
continent of South America, consists of three main regions: the
Caribbean, Mexico, and the Central American republics.  The Caribbean
region, the most culturally diverse of the three, consists of more than
seven thousand islands that stretch from the Bahamas to Barbados.  The
four largest islands of the Caribbean make up the *Greater Antilles*,
which include Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico.  Hispaniola is
made up of two halves: Haiti in the west and the Dominican Republic in
the east.  The smaller islands, extending all the way to South America,
make up the *Lesser Antilles*.  The island that is farthest south is
Trinidad, just off the coast of Venezuela.  The islands of the Bahamas
are situated closest to the U.S. mainland, located in the *Atlantic
Ocean*, and associated with the Caribbean region.*  
  
 *Central America refers to the seven states south of Mexico: Belize,
Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama. 
The *Pacific Ocean* borders Central America to the west, and the
Caribbean Sea borders these countries to the east.  While most of the
republics have both a Caribbean and a Pacific coastline, Belize has only
a Caribbean coast, and El Salvador has only a Pacific coast.*  
  
 *Your journey through Middle America begins with the exploration of the
physical characteristics of this region.  You will distinguish between
the Mayan and Aztec Empires and identify the impact of European
colonialism in Middle America, with particular attention to Spanish
influence in urban development.  The unit ends with an exploration of
physical and cultural characteristics of specific regions of the realm,
including Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.  In this unit, you
will also take a look at regional climatology, focusing on the
development and movement of tropical cyclones. *
