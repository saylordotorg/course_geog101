**Unit 13: The Pacific and Antarctica** <span id="13"></span> 
*Almost all of Antarctica rests south of the Antarctic Circle,
surrounded by the Southern Ocean.  The closest continent to Antarctica
is South America.  Many countries have laid claim to sections of
Antarctica, nevertheless the continent lacks industrial development.  In
the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Argentina, Australia, Chile, France,
Great Britain, New Zealand, and Norway announced claims to parts of
Antarctica.  In 1961, these nations and others signed the Antarctic
Treaty, essentially putting aside their territorial claims in the
interests of international cooperation in scientific research.  In 1991,
24 nations approved an addition to the treaty that would ban oil and
other mineral exploration for at least 50 years.*  
  
 *The hundreds of South Pacific islands are surrounded by the Pacific
Ocean and make up the largest geographic area in the world.  The Pacific
realm includes the island groups in the tropics between the Tropic of
Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn.  There has been little industrial
development in the South Pacific.  Just as Antarctica has been divided
up and claimed by other countries – though it was not colonized by them
– most of the islands in the South Pacific were claimed or colonized by
the imperial powers of Europe, Japan, or the United States.  Both areas
are considered to be peripheral realms in the overall scheme of the
global economy.  Tourism is the major activity in the South Pacific, and
research and tourism are the major activities in Antarctica.  Both
regions have opportunities for greater economic development in the
future.*  
  
 *Both the Pacific realm and Antarctica are impacted by climate change. 
Rising temperatures melt the polar caps, which in turn raise sea
levels.  Changes in precipitation patterns seriously alter the
biodiversity of tropical islands in the Pacific, while changes in
temperature and precipitation affect agricultural activity and tourism
on many islands.  Climate change in Antarctica could cause further
decline for the animals native to the realm.*  
  
 *Unit 13 begins with the exploration of physical and cultural
characteristics of the three groups of the islands of the South Pacific:
Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia.  During your exploration, you will
analyze the geographic characteristics (physical, cultural, and
political) of specific islands within the three groups.  Then, you will
travel to the Southern Ocean and the Antarctica, paying special
attention to environmental concerns such as climate change and ozone
depletion.*

**Unit 13 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 5.25 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 13.1: 1.75 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 13.2: 3.5 hours

**Unit13 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Identify, compare, and contrast the three components of the South
    Pacific Realm: Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia.
-   Distinguish between low islands and high islands.
-   Determine which islands remain under the auspices of France, the
    United Kingdom, New Zealand, or the United States.
-   Describe the primary economic activities of the islands in the
    realm.
-   Summarize the main environmental concerns of the islands in each
    region.
-   Describe the physical geography of Antarctica.
-   Discuss the political struggle of governing Antarctica and how the
    international community manages the continent.
-   List the features and effects of global warming. 
-   Explain the changes that would occur if the ice sheet covering
    Antarctica were to melt.
-   Identify and explain both natural and human causes of climate change
    on Earth.
-   Describe the carbon cycle, and explain how humans have influenced
    the carbon cycle since the Industrial Revolution.
-   Describe how the amount of ozone in the atmosphere above the South
    Pole changes during the seasons.
-   Explain how ozone in the stratosphere projects living organisms from
    incoming solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation.
