**Unit 8: North Africa & Southwest Asia** <span id="8"></span> 
*The realm of North Africa and Southwest Asia is large and expansive in
terms of physical area, but its regions share a number of common
qualities.  The physical area of this realm is divided into three
regions: North Africa, Southwest Asia, and the countries
of Turkestan (the geographic region of Central Asia).  The countries in
the North African region include those bordering the Mediterranean Sea
and the Red Sea, from Morocco to Sudan.  The realm borders the Atlantic
Ocean, the Sahara Desert, and the African Transition Zone.  Egypt has
territory in both Africa and Asia through its possession of the Sinai
Peninsula.  The second region, Southwest Asia, includes Turkey, Iran,
the Middle East, and the Arabian Peninsula.  The land on the eastern
shores of the Mediterranean Sea is frequently referred to as
the Levant and is often considered to be part of the Middle East. 
Central Asia, also referred to as Turkestan, includes the “stan”
countries from Kazakhstan to Afghanistan.  The suffix stan, meaning
“land of,” is a common suffix for nations in Central Asia.  Afghanistan
is the only country of Central Asia that was not officially a part of
the former Soviet Union.*  
  
 *Though each unit of this course is relevant and important, few units
are perhaps as important to present day global dynamics as this unit. 
Unit 8 begins with the identification of the three basic physical and
cultural traits the countries of the realm have in common: climate,
Islam, and natural resources.  In this unit, you will take a detailed
look at one of the more important “cultural hearths” of the region: the
availability and control of fresh water.  You will also analyze the
differences and similarities between the three most prevalent
monotheistic religions in this region of the world.  Finally, you will
take an in-depth look at major conflicts that have plagued the region
historically and presently.*
