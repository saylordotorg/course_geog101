**Unit 3: The Russian Realm** <span id="3"></span> 
*Russia is the largest country in the world in terms of physical area –
almost twice the size of the United States.  The country is so large in
fact, that a train journey from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok – the
respective western and eastern termini of the Trans-Siberian Railway –
takes about one week of constant travel to complete.  On this incredible
journey from coast to coast, you would travel through eight time zones! 
 *  
  
 *Russia extends from its European core (where most of the population
lives) across the Ural Mountains, into Siberia, and along to the Russian
Far East.  Its extensive landscape includes major metropolitan areas,
such as Moscow; vast territories in the Arctic north; immense forests of
Siberia; grain farms rivaling those in Kansas; and mountain communities
in the Caucasus.  Russia has a complicated history of monarchy and
totalitarianism, rich natural resources, extremes of wealth and poverty
(in fact, in the less populous areas, residents have more economic and
social connections with China than with Europe), and a slowly declining
population.  It is a dynamic country transitioning from a Communist
state to one that is becoming a vital part of the global economy.*  
  
 *Unit 3 begins with the exploration of the physical characteristics of
the Russian realm, along with an analysis of its cultural diversity and
regional environmental problems.  You will explore the historical
development patterns of Russia and its economy, beginning with the
Bolsheviks and Vladimir Lenin.  Next, you will examine the collapse of
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and the post-Soviet
economic and political situations that arose.  Finally, the unit ends
with a more detailed exploration of specific regions within the Russia
Realm.*
