**Unit 14: Course Conclusion and Globalization** <span id="14"></span> 
*This World Regional Geography course has taken you from continent to
continent and country to country.  Along our journey, we have explored
the particular physical and cultural characteristics that make each
place unique.  In addition, we have seen how colonialism and
globalization have blended and altered cultures, economies, and
political structures.  This final lecture takes a deeper look at
globalization and asks how globalization has affected regions, predicts
how globalization will affect regions, and theorizes the level of
integration or disintegration of regions due to globalization. *
