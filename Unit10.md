**Unit 10: East Asia** <span id="10"></span> 
*East Asia is home to one-fifth of the entire world population, with
China being the largest country in the realm.  The countries of
Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea, and Japan border the massive nation
of China.  East Asia’s location on the Pacific Rim has provided the
countries of the realm a port of access to the global economy.  The
manufacturing industry has fueled the high-tech engines of the Pacific
Rim economies, which have taken advantage of the massive labor pool of
the Chinese heartland.  The island of Taiwan, off the eastern coast of
China, has an independent government that has been separated from
mainland China since the end of World War II.  Hong Kong, a former
British possession with one of the best ports in Asia, is on the
southern coast of China.  The former Portuguese colony of Macau, which
has been returned to Chinese control, is just west of Hong Kong.  The
autonomous region of Tibet, referred to by its Chinese name, Xizang, is
in western China.  Tibet has been controlled by Communist China since
1949, shortly after the People’s Republic of China (PRC) was declared a
country. *  
  
 *In this unit, you will first study the wonderfully diverse physical
geography of East Asia.  East Asia is surrounded by a series of mountain
ranges in the west, Mongolia and Russia to the north, and Southeast Asia
to the south.  The Himalayas border Tibet and Nepal; the Karakoram
Ranges, Pamir’s, and the Tian Shan Mountains shadow Central Asia; and
the Altay Mountains are next to Russia.  The Himalayan Mountains are
among the highest mountain ranges in the world, and Mt. Everest is the
planet’s tallest peak standing at over 29,000 feet tall.  These high
ranges create a rain-shadow effect that dominates western China.*  
  
 *After you explore the physical geography of the region, you will then
analyze the impact of colonialism in China, and identify the various
countries and regions that were controlled by colonial interests. 
Additionally, you will explore the physical, political, economic, and
cultural characteristics of China, including its population dynamics and
the “One-Child-Only” policy.  The unit ends with an analysis of some of
the major physical and cultural characteristics of Japan, North Korea,
and South Korea.*
