**Unit 12: Australia and New Zealand** <span id="12"></span> 
*Australia and New Zealand have flora and fauna that are found nowhere
else on Earth.  Australia is an island, a country, and a continent – the
world’s smallest continent, but the only “Island Continent.”  No other
land mass can make those three claims.  Australia consists of a large
mainland and the island of Tasmania to the south.  The mainland of New
Zealand consists of two main islands, separated from Australia’s
southeastern region by the Tasman Sea.   
*  
 *The Indian Ocean surrounds Australia’s western and southern coasts. 
Indonesia and Papua New Guinea lie to the north, separated by the Timor
Sea and the Arafura Sea.  The Gulf of Carpentaria extends to the north
along Australia’s eastern coast, almost reaching Papua New Guinea. 
The Great Barrier Reef runs for more than 1,600 miles off the
continent’s northeastern shores, with the Coral Sea, which separates the
Great Barrier Reef from the South Pacific.  The southern side of
Australia is the Great Australian Bight, and the island of Tasmania. 
Finally, to the south of Australia and New Zealand is Antarctica. *  
  
 *The two countries have distinct physical geographies.  Australia is
relatively flat with low elevation highlands and an extensive dry
interior, while New Zealand has high mountains and receives more
rainfall.  New Zealand and Australia’s geographic isolation from the
rest of the world has allowed rare and extraordinary species to
flourish. It is quite a remarkable place.*  
  
 *Your journey through this unit begins with an exploration of the
Australian and New Zealand realm, with particular emphasis on the
physical geography of the region and the impact of colonialism to the
place and the Aboriginal people.  Next, you will explore the physical,
cultural, political, and economic characteristics of Australia and New
Zealand. *
