**Unit 7: Sub-Saharan Africa** <span id="7"></span> 
*Sub-Saharan Africa includes the African countries south of the Sahara
Desert.  This unit will also include many of the countries in the
African Transition Zone, which cuts across the southern edge of the
Sahara Desert, as part of the realm.  The realm can be further broken
down into regional components: Central Africa, East Africa, West Africa,
and Southern Africa.  At the eastern end of the African Transition Zone
is the Horn of Africa, which is often included in the region of East
Africa.  Maps vary in terms of which countries are included in each
region, but this general geographic breakdown is helpful in identifying
country locations and characteristics.  Madagascar is a large island off
the southeastern coast of Africa and is usually not included with the
other regions because its geographic qualities and biodiversity are
quite different from the mainland.*  
  
 *There is considerable variation in how the regions of Sub-Saharan
Africa are delineated and identified on maps.  The debate is not about
what regions are in Sub-Saharan Africa, but rather, which countries are
to be included within each region.  Cultural geography vastly differs
from country to country, and even amongst ethnic groups within
countries.  The diversity in human geography is one of the most
noteworthy dynamics in Sub-Saharan Africa.  The variety of ethnic
groups, languages, and religious affiliations create a thriving sea of
cultural diversity.*  
  
 *Globalization has allowed the once-remote regions of Sub-Saharan
Africa to connect with the rest of the world.  Advancements in
communication and transportation technology have created networks
connecting Africa with global markets.  The political arena is dynamic:
changes in political leadership through coups or military takeovers are
common, as is authoritarian rule.  Bitter civil wars are a part of the
region’s history, with violence and conflict continuing in some areas
today, while other areas exhibit political stability and thriving
economies.  However, Sub-Saharan Africa is still home to some of the
poorest countries in the world.  Poverty is evident in the countryside
and in the urban slums of the largest cities.   *  
  
 *Your exploration of Sub-Saharan Africa begins with the analysis of the
physical characteristics that make up the region.  You will then
discover which kingdoms and empires shaped the culture and people of
present-day Africa, with a specific look at how colonialism impacted
Sub-Saharan Africa.  As your journey through the regions of the world
has shown us thus far, wherever one goes in the world, one cannot escape
the cultural, political, and economic impact of European colonialism. *
