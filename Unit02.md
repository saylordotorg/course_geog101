**Unit 2: Europe** <span id="2"></span> 
*An understanding of the formation of Europe as we know it today – from
the dawn of the Roman Empire to the emergence of the European Union (EU)
(and beyond!) – is essential to the study of regional geography.  The
powerful impact of European colonialism is still felt today, and the
continent continues to struggle to confront the cultural forces that
unite and divide it.  The rural-to-urban shift prompted by the
Industrial Revolution first impacted Europe and continues to impact
developing countries.  Understanding the geographic region of Europe is
essential to understanding our world. *  
  
 *Unit 2 begins with the exploration of the physical characteristics and
natural resources of Europe.  You are given the opportunity to explore
the historical development of Europe, beginning with the Roman Empire
and the Viking Era.  Later in this unit, you learn about Europe’s
division in the twentieth century, unification efforts, and how
globalization has increased with the advent of the European Union.  Unit
2 ends with a detailed exploration of physical and cultural geography in
specific European regions.*
