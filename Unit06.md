**Unit 6: South America** <span id="6"></span> 
*The continent of South America has diverse physical landscapes, from
the high Andes Mountains to the tropical forests of the Amazon Basin. 
This assortment of physical features offers many natural resources. An
abundance of precious metals and fossil fuels, for example, are located
in Venezuela and Columbia, while the Amazon Basin is a source of
lumber.  More recently, some of the largest iron-ore mines in the world
were discovered in the Amazon Basin.  The massive plains of Brazil and
the rich soils of the Pampas allow for enormous agricultural operations
that provide food products for the continent and for the world.  Even
the inhospitable Atacama region in northern Chile holds some of the
world’s largest copper reserves.  In addition, the wide variety of
climate zones allows for a diverse ecosystem.  The extremes in physical
geography in South America have created both barriers and opportunities
to those who live there.*  
  
 *Unit 6 begins with the exploration of the diverse physical
characteristics of the South American realm.  You will also discover how
South America’s colonial legacy shaped its early cultural landscape, and
how European colonialism dominated the realm and divided the continent. 
Next, the unit explores unique cultural regions of South America and how
these regions influence globalization and trade.*
