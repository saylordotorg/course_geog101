**Unit 4: North America** <span id="4"></span> 
*The realm of North America extends from the polar regions of the Arctic
in northern Canada and Alaska, all the way south through Mexico and the
countries of Central America.  Geographers usually study the continent
by dividing it into two separate realms, based on differences in
physical and cultural geography.  In North America, the United States
and Canada share similar physical characteristics, as well as a similar
history of colonialism.  These two countries make up more than 13
percent of the world’s total landmass.  North America is bordered by the
Atlantic Ocean on the east, and the Pacific Ocean on the west.  To the
north is the Arctic Ocean. *  
  
 *North America is highly urbanized with approximately 80 percent of the
population living in cities.  Most of North America’s diverse population
consists of immigrants or descendants of immigrants from other world
regions.  The United States is the world’s largest economy, and it is
fair to say that both Canada and the United States enjoy high standards
of living.*  
  
 *Unit 4 begins with an exploration of the physical characteristics of
the North American realm, paying particular attention to its
physiographic regions.  Next, you will explore the influence of European
colonialism in the region.  Then, this unit takes a close look at
geographic boundaries and immigration patterns, urban growth, economic
development, globalization of the “American Dream,” shifts in
demographics, and the distribution of the dominant religious
affiliations in the United States. The latter portion of the unit
explores the physical and cultural characteristics of Canada.*
