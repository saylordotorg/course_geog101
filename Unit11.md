**Unit 11: Southeast Asia** <span id="11"></span> 
*The region between China, India, Australia, and the Pacific Ocean is
known as Southeast Asia.  Political borders in Southeast Asia were
created through a combination of factors, including natural features,
traditional tribal distinctions, colonial claims, and political
agreements.  Indonesia, the fourth-most populous country in the world,
is situated in this realm. *  
  
 *Southeast Asia is a region of peninsulas and islands.  The only
landlocked country is the rural country of Laos, which borders China,
Vietnam, and Thailand.  The physical geography of Southeast Asia
includes beaches, bays, inlets, and gulfs.  The thousands of islands in
Southeast Asia provide refuge for a variety of cultural groups.  For
example, the island of New Guinea has hundreds of local groups with
their own languages and traditions. * *Indonesians, Malays, and
Filipinos, coinciding with the countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the
Philippines, dominate the large number of ethnic groups. Each of these
main groups has many subgroups that hold to their own cultural heritage
in the areas where they exist.  The many islands of Indonesia and the
Philippines create the opportunity for diversity to continue to
thrive,in spite of the globalization process that has increased the
interaction and communication opportunities between groups.*  
  
 *Unit 11 begins with an exploration of the physical geography of
Southeast Asia, followed by analysis of the impact of colonialism to the
realm, and an introduction to the ethnic mosaic of the region.*
