**Unit 9: South Asia** <span id="9"></span> 
*Of the world’s seven continents, Asia is the largest.  Its physical
landscapes, political units, and ethnic groups are both numerous and
wide-ranging.  The entire region of Asia consists of Russia, Southwest
Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia.*   
  
 *The South Asia realm was the birthplace of two of the world’s great
religions: Hinduism and Buddhism.  Today South Asia also includes large
Muslim populations and large groups of followers of various other
religions.  Hinduism, Islam, and Buddhism are the top three religions of
South Asia.  While Pakistan and Iran are both Islamic republics, each
represents a significant branch of that faith; Iran is predominantly
Shia, and Pakistan is mostly Sunni.  Religious differences are also
evident on the eastern border of the realm, where Bangladesh and India
share a border with Myanmar.  Bangladesh is mainly a Muslim country,
while most in India align themselves with Hinduism.  In Myanmar, most
follow Buddhist traditions.  In addition, Sikhism is a major religion in
the Punjab region, which is located on India’s northern border with
Pakistan.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will explore and analyze the incredibly diverse
physical, cultural, political, and economic characteristics of South
Asia.  First, you will take a look at the physical geography of the
region, paying special attention to the climate of the realm; in
particular, the Indian Monsoon.  Next, you will explore regional
population growth.  The balancing of natural capital and population
growth is and will remain a primary issue in the realm’s future.  South
Asia is highly populated, with about one-and-a-half billion people
representing a wide range of ethnic and cultural groups.  The diverse
population has* *been brought together into political units that have
roots in the realm’s colonial past, primarily under Great Britain. 
British colonialism had a significant impact on the realm; its long-term
effects include political divisions and conflicts in places such as
Kashmir and Sri Lanka.  After you explore population, you will then
identify and analyze globalizing forces in the realm.  Current
globalizing forces are compelling South Asian countries to establish a
trade network and institute economic policies among themselves.  South
Asia is not one of the three main economic core areas of the world;
however, it is emerging to compete in the world marketplace.  Some would
call India a part of the semi-periphery, which means it is not actually
in the core or in the periphery but displays qualities of both.  India
remains the dominant country of South Asia and shares either a physical
boundary or a marine boundary with all the other countries in the
realm.  Finally, you will take an in-depth look at different physical
and cultural characteristics of specific countries within the realm,
paying special attending to religions of India and South Asia.*
