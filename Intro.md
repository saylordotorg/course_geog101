Geography is the study of the physical features of the Earth and its
atmosphere – including landscape development, weather and climate, and
geologic concepts – as well as the influence of human activity –
including cultural, economic, and political activity – on those physical
features.  Geography students, as they study the many aspects of our
physically and culturally diverse world, tend to become more adept at
tasks that require both spatial and critical thinking skills. World
Regional Geography covers the basic elements noted above but within a
regional context.  Ultimately, World Regional Geography is concerned
with the physical and human characteristics that make the regions of our
world distinctive.  As you progress through the course, the units will
discuss each major world region in detail, placing particular emphasis
on cultural and societal structures.  Regions will be discussed within a
global framework in the hope that you will gain a better comprehension
of how the world map is being defined and redefined.  In addition, you
will study key global issues such as international conflict and
cooperation, environmental degradation, population growth, and
globalization. This course makes primary use of a comprehensive textbook
to facilitate learning.  The concepts presented in World Regional
Geography will build upon one another as you progress through the
course.  Supplemental readings and online video lectures will be
integrated throughout each unit as well.

### Learning Outcomes

### Course Information

Welcome to GEOG 101: World Regional Geography.  Below, please find
general information on this course and its requirements.   
    
 **Course Designer:** Ken Yanow, Professor of Geographical Sciences,
Southwestern College  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following resources:

-   Sheppard Software: [“Geography
    Games”](http://www.sheppardsoftware.com/Geography.htm)
-   [*World Regional Geography: People, Places, and
    Globalization*](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/World%20Regional%20Geography.pdf)
-   iTunes U: Binghamton University: Professor Mark Reisinger’s
    [World Regional
    Geography](http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/geog151-world-regional-geography/id393916918?mt=2)
    Video Lectures (iTunes U)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
 You will also need to complete:

-   Subunit 1.1 Activity
-   Subunit 2.1 Activity
-   Subunit 4.1 Activity
-   Subunit 4.4 Activity
-   Subunit 5.2 Activity
-   Subunit 5.3 Activity
-   Subunit 5.4 Activity
-   Subunit 7.1 Activity
-   Subunit 8.4 Activity
-   Subunit 9.1 Activity
-   Subunit 12.1 Activity
-   The Final Exam

Please note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final
Exam.  However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will
need to work through the activities presented throughout the units.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you approximately **144.5
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These
should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have
over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take approximately 20.5 hours to
complete.  Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to
complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 5 hours) on Monday night; subunit 1.2
(a total of 3.25 hours) on Tuesday night; etc.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** Unit 1 provides an introduction to geography and
sets the foundation for the entire course.  Take your time with Unit 1
and be sure you feel comfortable with the concepts and Learning
Objectives before progressing to the next unit.    
  
 Many of the units include a map activity.  It is very important that
you can locate geographic areas, referenced in the course readings and
lectures, on a map.  It is also advisable to complete the resources in
sequential order as they are assigned.  
  
 The chapters and sections assigned from the course textbook, *World
Regional Geography: People, Places, and Globalization,* align with the
subunit and sub-subunit breakdown of the course.  Each section of the
textbook also contains a series of “Discussion and Study” questions. 
Before you read the assigned section or chapter, be sure to review the
end-of-section Discussion and Study questions first, and then begin your
reading.  While you are reading the text and watching the lectures, you
will want to be actively answering and considering the questions.  This
will make the learning process much more engaging and efficient.
