**Unit 1: Introduction to Geography** <span id="1"></span> 
*Geography, derived from the Greek geo (“Earth”) and graphein (“to
write”), examines the physical world, human world, and the spatial
relationships between physical and cultural phenomena.  Geographers
study the Earth’s physical characteristics, its inhabitants and
cultures, phenomena such as climate, and the Earth’s place within the
universe.  Geographers also look at how the earth, its climate, and its
landscapes are changing due to cultural intervention. *  
    
 *Unit 1 examines the foundational scientific principles of geography. 
In this first unit, you will be introduced to the disciplines of
geography and their basic components.  You will also learn about
critical concepts in the discipline, such as the relationships between
people and place, climate change, population increase, urbanization, and
globalization.*
